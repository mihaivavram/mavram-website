                    in a social network.  For instance, if a person has very

                    amount of time, what are the most optimal moves that
                    the given person should make in order to achieve the

                    Fakey is a game with a purpose where players are
                    placed in a simulated social media news feed and are
                    tasked with disambiguating between high-quality news
                    and lower quality news such as fake, bias, conspiracy,
                    junk science, etc. The players are constructively
                    directed towards creating a good social media experience
                    where good information is shared and false information
                    is fact-checked. We created this game for media literacy
                    as well as for research in uncovering patterns in
                    the way people interact with social media news feeds.

                    Our approach was to take very large graphs which
                    contained 300M+ nodes and 1B+ edges and count the
                    number of embeddings (sequences of DNA for instance,
                    or number of single-child families).  In order to perform
                    such a feat, we used an HPC Machine Learning framework

                <b>Lessons Learned:</b>
                The practice of minimizing the nonessential and focusing time
                on the essential at a macro and micro level (hence I minimized
                social media use and quit using Snapchat for once!). Social
                impact is my harmonious passion. I often think about the best
                ways to achieve the highest social impact in the world as possible.
                Not because I want money, glory, or fame, but because I think
                it our responsability to give back and leave the world a little
                better off when we die.  This is related to the concept of

                and sacrifice - especially without a large support group in
                assistance. As demanding as research/academia/entrepreneurship
                may be, social connections and friendships should never be
