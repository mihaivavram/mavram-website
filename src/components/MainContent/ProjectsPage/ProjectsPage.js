              In this project we are aiming to find the optimal adversarial
              sequence which can yield positive or negative outcomes
              in a social network.  For instance, if a person has very
              few friends and wants to be very influential in a short
              amount of time, what are the most optimal moves that
              the given person should make in order to achieve the
              maximum amount of influence. So far, we have created a
              Python framework that can perform adversarial perturbations
              using various user-defined metrics such as configured graphs,
              node positions, budget functions and costs, and evaluation metrics.

              Fakey is a game with a purpose where players are
              placed in a simulated social media news feed and are
              tasked with disambiguating between high-quality news
              and lower quality news such as fake, bias, conspiracy,
              junk science, etc. The players are constructively
              directed towards creating a good social media experience
              where good information is shared and false information
              is fact-checked. We created this game for media literacy
              as well as for research in uncovering patterns in
              the way people interact with social media news feeds.
              Currently we are brainstorming extra features we should add
              to Fakey.

              be real news, fake news, and any spectrum in between.

              Our approach was to take very large graphs which
              contained 300M+ nodes and 1B+ edges and count the
              number of embeddings (sequences of DNA for instance,
              or number of single-child families).  In order to perform
              such a feat, we used an HPC Machine Learning framework
              called
              <a target="_blank"

              and implemented various algorithms that could scale to
              many nodes and edges using a high-performance computing
              setup with many nodes, cores, threads, and shared memory.

              was Elon Musk using Machine Learning and Network Science
              approaches.
