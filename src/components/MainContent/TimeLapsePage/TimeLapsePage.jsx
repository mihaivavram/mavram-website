            For those of us lucky enough to be living in a developed nation, 
            the most scarce resource we have is time, not money. I have also
            realized that the way I like to work is by taking the approach of 
            a software architect and leader. I love to understand and plan 
            all the components of how a tech product is made, from the back-end,
            the front-end, and everything in between. This also includes agile
            and lean methodology such as successfully following processes to
            lead a software team into success.

            When referring to startups, just because you built it, it doesn't
            mean they will come! Often it takes a lot of <a target="_blank"

            waking up earlier is a surefire way to get more work done during
            the day because for morning-people like myself, we have the most
            energy then so we can get more work done without other distractions
            like calls, meetings, or important emails that happen later in the
            day. Finally, I am realizing that I love to build useful things.
            I think this should better help me navigate life and my career by
            using that as my one true north.

            I also started working with Elliott Adams on his security startup

            web scraping/automation, and back-end/front-end work done.

            The more I freelance, code, learn, and build things, the more I am
            realizing that I really love to do this. Hence, I have started to
            form my own entrepreneurial philosophy so to speak. I think every
            person should do this because it allows one to live
            on their own terms. This way it becomes clearer which opportunities
            to say yes to, and which can take a back seat for now. As of now,
            my entrepreneurial mentality is mostly a bootstrap-first mentality.
            Although I do believe that external funding such as Angel Investors
            or VCs have their role in empowering scalability and massive growth,
            there's a time and a place for that. At the very beginning of a
            company's growth, I think it is paramount for the founders to try
            to keep things as lean as possible, without much external investors
            as they think about what artifacts of the company they are willing
            to compromise and which ones to retain full control over.
            The founders should allso figure out
            what they love to do when it comes to building companies
            (e.g. coding, marketing, interviewing, ideating, etc.). The moment
            external funding comes in, all of these questions get suspended
            in flux, and the founders have limited control in some decisions
            of how to run the company, and what they do day to day. I plan to
            not give away this control if possible, and the day that I do
            decide that I am ready for it, hopefully, I will have figured out
            my uncompromising aspirations for the company I am building, and
            how I would like to work. As of now, I plan to spend at least half
            my time coding and building since it brings me a lot of joy.

            and Sendgrid for e-mail pipelines. Another client I worked with
            involved doing some analysis and benchmarking on machine learning
            frameworks which can detect automated accounts on social media.
            I also helped another client by creating a smart network analysis
            tool to analyze and simulate a semblance of a smart city.

            One of the most important investments we can make is in ourselves
            through learning or thinking about how we can improve our lives.
            In the past, I haven't made enough time to learn or think about
            life optimizations; however, I have pledged to try to learn at least
            two hours per day while taking the time to journal and think in the

            Although this has been on my mind for some time, at this point in time
            I believe the notion cannot be more overt. This is the notion that
            I am mostly driven by real-world impact. More specifically,
            I get a lot of satisfaction from making things.
            The euphoria of a completed product that makes the world a better place
            cannot be matched by any other joyful event. Hence, I have decided

            The practice of minimizing the nonessential and focusing time
            on the essential at a macro and micro level (hence I minimized
            social media use and quit using Snapchat for once!). Social
            impact is my harmonious passion. I often think about the best
            ways to achieve the highest social impact in the world as possible.
            Not because I want money, glory, or fame, but because I think
            it our responsability to give back and leave the world a little
            better off when we die.  This is related to the concept

            Hopefully this literature review will better allow me to pick
            certain sub-areas of research in order to have the most impact
            and fun in the future. I also learned to find a good work/life
            balance for myself in the academic environment.

            Focus on the essential and do your best, as trying to do e
            verything is the recipe for failure. Honed Machine Learning, Graph Algorithms, Linux, and
            High-Performance Computing skills.

            Research is hard work, but I prefer doing research to
            taking classes because it gives me creativity, a sense of
            purpose, and flexibility.

            Started my Master's in Computer Science
            and completed the following courses: Algorithms Design and
            Analysis, Advanced Operating Systems, and Machine Learning.
            Also started working with Dr. Filippo Menczer on Fact Checking,
            later publishing a paper in WSDM Cup 2017.

            Graduate school is hard work, but surrounding oneself with
            what one values most can make the time more pleasant. For me
            this was doing research and outdoor activities such as running,
            climbing, tennis, basketball, etc...

            <br></br>
            Worked as a Consultant, later being promoted to Senior
            Consultant at Avanade, a technology company. I learned a lot
            about dev-ops, the application development lifecycle, team leadership,
            Web Development, and Big Data here.

            Working in industry is good money, but if one wants to make
            a difference in the world then a career in research, nonprofit,
            or entrepreneurship would be a better fit. This is when I
            chose to pursue a research-oriented Master's degree in Computer
            Science.

            Graduated from Purdue University with a Bachelor of Science
            in Mathematics. I also gleaned some neat skills in Computer
            Science, by attending an REU at University of Michigan and
            working with professor Sorin Matei on a publication about
            the Iraq War.

            The meaning of giving back through Purdue's EPICS program.
            NOT to procrastinate. Critical thinking is the key to a
            bachelor's degree, everything else can be forgotten.
